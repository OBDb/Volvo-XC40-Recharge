    description: "The Volvo XC40 Recharge is Volvo's first all-electric vehicle, based on the conventional XC40 compact luxury crossover. Introduced in 2020, it represents a pivotal step in Volvo's commitment to electrification and sustainability. While sharing the basic exterior and interior design with the standard XC40, the Recharge features distinctive elements including a closed-off front grille (as no traditional radiator is needed), unique wheel designs, and model-specific color options. Initially launched as the P8 AWD model, it features a dual-motor electric powertrain producing 402 horsepower (300 kW) and 486 lb-ft of torque, enabling a 0-60 mph time of approximately 4.7 seconds. Power comes from a 78 kWh battery pack providing an EPA-rated range of around 223 miles (later improved in subsequent model years). The interior offers the same practical and stylish cabin as the standard XC40 but was among the first Volvo models to feature the Google-based infotainment system with built-in Google Maps, Google Assistant, and access to the Google Play Store. The lack of an internal combustion engine creates additional front storage space (frunk). Safety features remain comprehensive, including all of Volvo's advanced driver assistance systems. In 2022, a single-motor front-wheel drive variant was added to the lineup, offering increased range and a lower entry price. The XC40 Recharge successfully combines Volvo's premium qualities and safety leadership with zero-emission electric propulsion, appealing to environmentally conscious luxury buyers."
